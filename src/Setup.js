// In the desktop app, this type stored settings as indices, which referenced
// specific selections in the UI, and translated those on demand into 'real'
// terms, such as word count ranges or time bonuses. That approach makes it
// difficult to change settings options later, however, so this class stores
// settings in 'real' terms, and leaves the UI to map those onto specific UI
// states.
