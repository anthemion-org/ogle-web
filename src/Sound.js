// Audio on mobile devices
// -----------------------
// Audio performance on Android devices is truly abysmal. The playback latency
// is often very long, the loop timing is extremely variable (even though tTimer
// regulates the timing), my devices won't loop faster than once per second, and
// the volume on the Pixel 4a waxes and wanes very noticeably for no reason I
// can understand. I have therefore decided to disable audio on all mobile
// devices, which might be what users prefer in the first place.
//
//
// Audio loading problems
// ----------------------
// Twice I have encountered WAV file loading problems in this module that were
// very difficult to diagnose. In both cases, the development build stopped
// playing sounds, and this confusing message appeared in the DevTools console:
//
//   DOMException: The element has no supported sources
//
// In actual fact, 'null' values were being returned when 'querySelector' was
// used to reference the 'audio' elements. No changes had been made to the WAV
// files, however, and reverting to earlier commits did not fix the problem. In
// both cases, production builds continued to play sounds as expected.
//
// The first time this happened, I was able to fix it by restarting the
// development server with 'npm run start'. The second time, restarts did not
// help, nor did a reboot of my development PC. Looking at the WAV files in the
// DevTools Network tab, it appeared that the files were not being completely
// loaded, as their size was reported as 2.9KB in each case, even though most
// are larger. Then I noticed that the development server was setting their
// 'Content-Type' to 'text/plain', while the production server correctly set
// this to 'audio/wav'. I considered reconfiguring the WebPack development
// server to ensure that the correct type would be set, but it seemed like I
// would need something like 'react-app-rewired', which I do not want right now.
//
// Finally, I noticed that changing the development URL from:
//
//   http://localhost:3000
//
// to:
//
//   http://localhost:3000/play-ogle/
//
// allowed the sounds to be played. The second URL is the one listed by 'npm
// start', though it was not originally. I traced that change to the 'homepage'
// property I added to 'package.json' nine days ago. If that is the cause, I
// don't understand why it would take so long for the problem to appear, and it
// is hard to believe that the files were cached this whole time.
//
// So, finally, I prefixed the 'audio' element paths in 'index.html' with
// '%PUBLIC_URL%'. This changes the served HTML from:
//
//   <audio id="AudPointOver" src="AudPointOver.wav"></audio>
//
// to:
//
//   <audio id="AudPointOver" src="/play-ogle/AudPointOver.wav"></audio>
//
// Now the sounds play whether '/play-ogle/' is appended to 'localhost:3000' or
// not. These files were always siblings of the 'index.html' file that
// references them, so I don't understand this fix, nor do I understand why the
// development server would fail this way, if the paths were simply wrong.
