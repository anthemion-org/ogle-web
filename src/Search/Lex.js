// 'Searchable' words include built-in words, plus user-entered words that have
// been merged. Only these words can be found with the Ogle word search.
//
// 'Known' words include built-in words and user-entered words, whether merged
// or not. These can be checked with uCkKnown, but they cannot necessarily be
// found with a word search.
//
// I distinguished these because the tLookupText search requires random access
// to the searchable words, and I didn't want to sort those every time the user
// adds a new word, especially when it is already too late to include them in
// the current round. We do want to find the new words if the user re-enters
// them in the same round, however. Now I wonder whether immediate merging would
// be better. If so, this can be greatly simplified. [refactor]
